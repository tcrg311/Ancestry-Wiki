German church records<ref>Württemberg, Germany, Family Tables, 1550-1985 [database on-line]. Lehi, UT, USA, Konfirmationen u· Familienregister 1742-1886</ref> show that Conrad was born 26 Jan 1772, and confirmed in 1786.  According to the Frieden Lutheran and Reformed Church<ref>German Church Records of Rockingham County, Vol 1, Translated and compiled by Brigitte Burkett, Picton Press, Rockport, Maine, page 9</ref> Conrads first child, Elisabeth, was baptized 19 Feb 1792.  His birth year is calculated to be 1760-1770.

Conrad Cline received land from John Cline, likely his father.  The Rockingham County deed index<ref>General index to deeds, grantors and grantees, Vol. 4, 1778-1863, Virginia. County Court (Rockingham County) (Main Author), Salt Lake City, Utah : Filmed by the Genealogical Society of Utah, 1952</ref> shows Sep 1799 as the date of transfer, and that nothing of the deed survived.

His relationship to his daughters is confirmed by the marriage bonds<ref>Rockingham County Marriage Bonds & Consents, 1817 - 1835, Library of Virginia reel 683</ref>.

Until 1833, the land tax shows an 8 miles south "Distance and Bearing" from the courthouse.  A new courthouse was built "1833-1834"<ref>"Courthouse Square in Early Harrisonburg and Activities Connected with Court Days", Dale MacAllister, 2005, https://www.rockinghamcountyva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/179/Courthouse-Square-in-Early-Harrisonburg--Activities-Connected-with-Court-Days?bidId=</ref>.  In 1833 the land tax shows the bearing is SE of the courthouse.  (The distance is hidden in the microfilmed document, but later is consistenly shown to be 10 miles.)  This puts the land roughly half way between Cross Keys and Port Republic.

Conrad Cline died about 1835, and his son Peter was administrator of the "incuperative will"<ref>Administrators' Bonds, 1778-1874; Author: Virginia. Circuit Court (Rockingham County); Probate Place: Rockingham, Virginia</ref>.  Rockingham County deed index shows that a deed occurred in April 1834, Conrad Cline was grantor and Peter Cline was grantee.  None of the deed survived.  The Rockingham County land tax for 1836<ref>Land tax lists of Rockingham County [Virginia] 1782-1863, image 749</ref> shows Peter Cline with 96 acres on Faughts Branch, inherited from Conrad.

Peter Cline died 8 Jul 1857.  A deed 2 Jan 1858<ref>{{FamilySearch Image|3Q9M-CSPP-NSNY-B}}</ref> shows the daughters and their husbands selling the land to Wiliam Moyerheffer.  The land lies "on a branch of Faughts run".  Neighboring lands are owned by Jacob Ruebush and Jacob Earman, possibly with other neighbors whose names did not survive after burning.  Notably, the deed shows that daughter Mary Ann is unmarried.

Rockingham County Land Tax for 1836 shows Peter Cline owned the 96 acres on Faugths Creek "By Conrad Cline". Conrad had died in 1835, but transferred the land to Peter in April 1835, before his death<ref>Burnt Deed Book 11, Page 533, Rockingham County, Virginia.  None survived.</ref>

After Conrad died:
# Peter Cline inherited
# Peter Cline's heirs sold to William Meyerhoeffer 2 Jan 1858<ref>Burnt deed book, v. 31, 1857-1858, Rockingham County, p. 457, https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSPP-NSNY-B?cat=386882</ref>.  As described in the deed, the land is on Faught's Run and contains 96 acres.  Adjoining land is owned by Jacob Earman and Jacob Reubush.
# William Meyerhoeffer sold to Elizabeth [Jane], William J and George L Shenk<ref>Deed book, v. 4, 1869-1870, 1867-1868, Rockingham County, https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3Q9M-CSYX-VXQ4?i=643&cat=1174519</ref>.  Elizabeth is mother, and "Mrs. Jane Shenk" has a location in the 1885 map of Rockingham County<ref>Atlas of Rockingham County Virginia, D. J. Lake & Co., 1885, Reprinted by Harrisonburg-Rockingham Historical Society, Dayton, Virginia, 2013, P 7 I-4</ref>.  This deed describes the land "situated on a branch of Faught's and being the same land that formerly belonged to Peter Cline dec'd".  Adjoining land is owned by Jacob Earman and Jacob Ruebush.

Rockingham Atlas Published by D. J. Lake and Co. in 1885, page 7, Ashby Magisterial District - East, Dayton, Spring Creek, Bridgewater, Pleasant Valley Right, shows "Mrs. Jane Shenk" just south of "Mrs. E. Earman", just southwest of Cross Keys, on land near Faught's Branch, which runs parallel to Friedens Church Road.
