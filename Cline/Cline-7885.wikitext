== Research Notes ==

=== Birth ===
"Kline John (of Conr." first appeared in the 1819 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list.
* Conrad Cline's tithable count increased to 2 in 1817.
* It was still 2 in 1819, but was reduced to 1 in 1820.  Conrad's son Peter Cline would have been 21 in 1819<ref>1850 United States Federal Census, Year: 1850; Census Place: District 56, Rockingham, Virginia; Roll: M432_974; Image: 345</ref><ref>Rockingham County, Virginia, Death Index, 1853-1861</ref><ref>Tombstone image, Find a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54746398/peter-cline: accessed July 4, 2024), memorial page for Peter Cline (17 Aug 1798–8 Jul 1857), Find a Grave Memorial ID 54746398, citing Friedens United Church of Christ Cemetery, Friedens, Rockingham County, Virginia, USA; Maintained by Anonymous (contributor 47074340).</ref>,
* The tithable count was not enumerated in the tax lists from 1821-1829.
* "Peter Cline of Conrad" first appeared in the 1830 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list, at age 32.

With the assumption that "Kline John (of Conr." in the 1819 property tax is the same person as John B Cline in 1830 property tax, the birth year is calculated based on the following:
# Married without father's consent in 1809 = 1788 or before
# Census 1810 age 16-25 = 1785-1794
# Census 1820 age 26-44 = 1776-1794
# Census 1830 age 40-49 = 1781-1790
Birth year range is 1785-1788

=== Parents ===
Based on the birth year calculation and the assumption that "Kline John (of Conr." in the 1819 property tax is the same person as John B Cline in 1830 property tax, it is unlikely that John B Cline is the ''son'' of Conrad Cline, since Conrad would have been at most 16 years old when John B Cline was born.

Possibilities:
# He is Conrad's brother.  In this case, based on birth year, Johannes Klein is his father and Christina Catharina Wacker is his mother.  Because he is not named among Johannes and Christina's children in the Schlierbach Konfirmationen u· Familienregister 1742-1886, this seems less likely.
# He is Conrad's cousin or nephew.

There is another "Klein" family in the Schlierbach Konfirmationen u· Familienregister:
* Joseph Klein b. 7 Jan 1740, d. 10 Jan 1818 &#91;in Virginia.  See Spouse (3)&#93;
* Spouse (1) Elisabetha Hausmann b. 6 Jan 1726, (no marriage date), d. 8 Nov 1785; d/o Lorentz Hausmann and Euphrosina Schwartz
* Spouse (2) Anna Eberlin b. 11 Oct 1751, m. 9 May 1786, d. 13 Mar 1788; d/o Jakob Eberlin and Anna Kohler
* Spouse (3) Maria Barbara Schmid b 7 May 1742, m. 14 Oct 1788, d. 17 Mar 1813 in Virginia; d/o Christoph Schmid and Anna Maria Rebstock
* Parents of Joseph:  Benedict Klein and Elisabetha Frowein
* No children are listed in the family register.

To put John B. Cline in this family is speculative but plausible
* It is possible that his middle name could be "Benedict".
* It is possible that Anna Eberlin is his mother, and died giving birth.
* It is possible that Maria Barbara is his mother, and he is the "first fruit" of the marriage.



=== Marriage ===
John and Susannah's marriage is listed in John Brown's minister's return.  Also included in the return's long list are Peter Cline to Christina Royer, Jacob Koontz to Nancy Cline, and other daughters of Conrad and Marie Cline.
