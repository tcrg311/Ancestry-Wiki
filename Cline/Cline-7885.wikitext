* Conrad Cline's tithable count increased to 2 in 1817.
* It was still 2 in 1819, but was reduced to 1 in 1820.  Conrad's son Peter Cline would have been 21 in 1819<ref>1850 United States Federal Census, Year: 1850; Census Place: District 56, Rockingham, Virginia; Roll: M432_974; Image: 345</ref><ref>Rockingham County, Virginia, Death Index, 1853-1861</ref><ref>Tombstone image, Find a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54746398/peter-cline: accessed July 4, 2024), memorial page for Peter Cline (17 Aug 1798â€“8 Jul 1857), Find a Grave Memorial ID 54746398, citing Friedens United Church of Christ Cemetery, Friedens, Rockingham County, Virginia, USA; Maintained by Anonymous (contributor 47074340).</ref>,

* "Peter Cline of Conrad" first appears in the 1830 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list, at age 32.

Calculating birth year:
# Married without father's consent in 1809 = 1788 or before
# Census 1810 age 16-25 = 1785-1794
# Census 1820 age 26-44 = 1776-1794
# Census 1830 age 40-49 = 1781-1790
Birth year range is 1785-1788

=== Parents ===

Usually "of Conr[ad]" in the tax list is an indicator of a father-son relationship, however the age difference suggests the more likely possibility of their being brothers.  Since Conrad had no sons until Peter's birth in 1798, it is possible that John lived with Conrad and helped with the farming.

If it is true that John B is Conrad's brother, then Johannes is his father.  If the birth year calculation is correct, then John B was born before Christina Catharina Wacker died, and she is his mother.

=== Marriage ===
John and Susannah's marriage is listed in John Brown's minister's return.  Also included in the return's long list are Peter Cline to Christina Royer, Jacob Koontz to Nancy Cline, and other daughters of Conrad and Marie Cline.
