== Research Notes ==

=== Birth ===
Birth year is based on Conrad's estimated birth year, and it is possible that he was born earlier than 1740.

=== Marriage ===
John's wife's name is unknown, and it is not know if he was married more than once.

=== Residence ===
There was a land grant survey for "John Clyne" 20 Apr 1774<ref>Land Grant Surveys, Wayland, page 90</ref> for 400 acres on the Mononghela River, adjoining John Carter and James Stockwell.  The connection of this reference is unconfirmed.

Rockingham County, Virginia, 1787-1799<ref>Rockingham County [Virginia] Personal Property Tax, 1787, page 7, Another filming, 1992, of lists 1782-1794, {{FamilySearch Image|3Q9M-CS79-LBNY}}</ref>

=== Children ===
Conrad and Adam received land from John in 1795<ref>Rockingham County Land Tax, {{FamilySearch Image|3Q9M-CS4C-R7J6-N}}</ref>.

Stophel Cline appears 1788-1792 in the Rockingham County Property Tax records<ref>Rockingham County Personal Property Tax</ref>, but his relationship to John Cline is undetermined.

=== Death ===
Death year is based on the assumption that John's death occurred about the time he stopped being listed in the Rockingham tax records, and he was last listed in the year 1799.

Since Adam was also last listed in the 1799 Rockingham tax records, it is also possible that John went somewhere with Adam and his family.
