=== Residence in Rockingham ===
Adam Cline is listed in the Rockingham County Personal Property Tax from 1792-1799<ref>Rockingham County Personal Property Tax</ref>.

The 1795 Rockingham County Land Tax shows that Adam received 164 acres from John Cline.  There was no deed.

There is a burnt deed index entry dated Sep 1799 with "______ Cline" as grantor and "C. Cline" as grantee.  None of the deed survived.  The date matches the timeframe when Adam appears to have left Rockingham, but Conrad Cline's acreage in the land tax did not change.

There is a burnt deed date 17 Sep 1799<ref>Burnt Deed Book 00, page 363</ref> that accounts for the 164 acres:

:...said John Gibson and Catharine his wife former Catharine Cloverfield, for and in consideration of the sum of one hundred Dollars to them in hand '''paid by John Cline''' the receipt thereof they do hereby acknowledge hath given granted bargained and sold unto the Aforesaid George Congwere and his heirs & Assigns for ever one full moiety on their full part of a certaint tract of Land containing one hundred & sixty four Acres be the same more or less granted to Gasper Miller by patent letters dated the 27th day of August 1770 and by him conveyed to Mary Cloverfield (now Crookshank) and Catharine Cloverfield (now the present wife of the said John Gibson[)] by deed of Bargain and Sale Dated the 26th day of August 1782.
