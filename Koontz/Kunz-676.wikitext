=== Birth ===

Phillip's Revolutionary War pension application<ref>Ancestry.com. U.S., Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty-Land Warrant Application Files, 1800-1900 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010.  Original data:Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty-Land Warrant Application Files (NARA microfilm publication M804, 2,670 rolls). Records of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Record Group 15. National Archives, Washington, D.C.</ref> (Virginia 12.473) provides the following information:

:''He was born in the state of Maryland he cannot say positively what year, but believes his age to be about eighty, he has no record of his age.  He removed to Virginia when he was about nineteen years of age, and lived on the South Branch about two years, and then removed to Rockingham County, where he has resided since.

In a deposition 13 Nov 1802 for Chancery Cause Woodley vs March, Phillip offered that he was 50 years old.  Both this and the pension application put his birth year at 1752.  In the 1830 census, Phillip is in the "70 to 80" age bracket, keeping is birth year about 1752.  In a census of veterans in 1841, however, he offered that he was 95 years old, suggesting that the dates could be about 5 or 6 years earlier, 1746.

Placing more reliability on Phillip's earlier statements of his age:
* Phillip was born Abt. 1752.
* Peter and Phillip, possibly with other siblings, migrated to South Branch of the Potomac (now in West Virginia) around 1771
* They migrated to the Rockingham County area around 1773.

=== Marriage ===

An 1844 Chancery cause (see Chancery Record below) brought by Eli, Phillip's administrator (and grandson), Phillip's wife's name was Rebecca.  Her name in the marriage bond is "Peggy Bond".  "Margaret" was her mother's name.

=== Chancery Record for ADMR OF Phillip Koontz SR vs. Peter Derrow ETC ===

The Chancery Record 1844-005<ref>Virginia Memory, Chancery Record Index, Rockingham County, original case number 008, https://www.lva.virginia.gov/chancery/case_detail.asp?CFN=165-1844-005</ref> contains a bill dated 22 Feb 1844.  The bill is complaining that the money due from a "suit at Law in the circuit[?] Superior court of law and chancery for the county of Rockingham" has not been recovered.

* Eli [H] Koontz is administrator for Phillip Koontz Senr. and represents the estate as the plaintiff.
* The bill describes a land transaction where "said [Phillip] Koontz [Senr] together with his wife Rebecca Koontz...sold and conveyed" some land to John Wists for $240.
* John Wists was not able to pay down the $186.40 he owed Phillip Sr for the land, and so he "conveyed the same by Deed of the date 31st August 1822 to Philip Koontz Jun in Trust to secure the payment of the said $186.40 on the 1st of September 1826 with Interest..."
*  Eli "further represents that the said Philip Koonts Jun. departed this life on the 16th day of Dec 1825. after having first made his Last Will and Testament wherein he appointed his son Peter P Koonts Ex'r thereof..."
* This land changed hands, and on the "10th day of April 1841 the said Harmon Houck conveyed the said two tracts of land...together with some other property to Reuben Koonts another son of the said Philip Koontz Jun."
* Eli "further states that on the ___ day of ___ 184_ the said Philip Koonts Senr. departed this life intestate and that on the ___ day of ____ 1842 Administration of his estate was granted to your orator [Eli] by the county court of Rockingham".
* It appears that because the transactions include sale by Peter P Koontz and money was distributed to the children of Philip Koontz Jr, Eli is asking that all of Philip Koontz Jr's children be made "Defendents to this bill":  "Peter P. Koonts, Wilson A Koonts, & Elizabeth Koonts of Rockingham and William Wood & Mary Wood his wife, Simeon Roach & Dianna Roach his wife of chir[?], & Sabina Freeman wife of Woodville A. Freeman of Kentucky who together with your orator Eli H. Koonts are the children & heirs of Philip Koonts Jun. and who are also the brothers & sisters & heirs of Reuben Koonts another son of the said Philip Koonts Jun. who died intestate & unmarried and without other heirs than his said brothers & sisters..."
