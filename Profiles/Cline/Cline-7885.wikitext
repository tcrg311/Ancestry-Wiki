== Research Notes ==

=== Parents ===
"Kline John (of Conr." first appeared in the 1819 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list.

Of Conrad Cline's known children, John B. and Mary Ann do not appear in the Friedens Church baptismal records.  The earliest baptismal record is for Elisabeth<ref>German Church Records of Rockingham County, Vol 1, Translated and compiled by Brigitte Burkett, Picton Press, Rockport, Maine, page 9</ref> b. 19 Feb 1792, which identifies her parents "Conrad Klein & wife Maria".

John B. and Mary are estimated to have been born by or about 1877, based on marriage (both married in 1809) and census documents.  It is commonly understood that "Maria" is Maria Ruebush (or Raudenbusch), and that she was born about 1776.  It is possible Maria Ruebush is not the mother of John B. and Mary Ann, or that Maria Ruebush is older than commonly understood.

=== Birth ===
Property Tax lists:
* Conrad Cline's tithable count increased to 2 1806-1807 (there was no tax in 1808).
* Conrad Cline's tithable count decreased to 1 in 1809.
* John Cline is listed just after Conrad in 1810, 1811, 1812, 1813, .
* "Kline John (of Conr." first appeared in the 1819 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list.

With the assumption that "Kline John (of Conr." in the 1819 property tax is the same person as John B Cline in 1830 property tax, the birth year is calculated based on the following:
# There is no record of a father's consent<ref>According to Virginia law, individuals under the age of twenty-one needed the consent of a parent or guardian to marry.</ref> for his marriage to Susanna in 1809 = 1788 or before
# Census 1810<ref>"United States Census, 1810", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XH2Q-8D3 : Sun Mar 10 21:46:57 UTC 2024), Entry for John Kline, 1810.</ref> age 16-25 = 1785-1794
# Census 1820<ref>"United States Census, 1820", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHLZ-T7P : Thu Mar 07 18:07:19 UTC 2024), Entry for John Cline, 1820.</ref> age 26-44 = 1776-1794
# Census 1830<ref>"United States Census, 1830", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XH5N-PMP : Sat Mar 09 04:36:24 UTC 2024), Entry for John Cline, 1830.</ref> age 40-49 = 1781-1790
Birth year range is 1785-1788

Harrison ("D H")<ref>"United States Census, 1880", , FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MF5H-RWH : Wed Jul 17 02:06:23 UTC 2024), Entry for D. H. Cline and Elizabeth Cline, 1880.</ref>, Samuel<ref>"United States Census, 1880", , FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MHMR-1KF : Mon Jul 08 08:31:38 UTC 2024), Entry for Samuel Cline and Delila Cline, 1880.</ref> and Elias<ref>"United States Census, 1880", , FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MHMR-1K7 : Sun Jul 07 11:29:21 UTC 2024), Entry for Elias Cline and Martha J. Cline, 1880.</ref> are among the children who were enumerated in the 1880, the first census to include parents' birthplaces.  All identify Virginia as their father's birthplace.

=== Marriage ===
John and Susannah's marriage is listed in John Brown's minister's return.  Also included in the return's long list are Peter Cline to Christina Royer, Jacob Koontz to Nancy Cline, and other daughters of Conrad and Marie Cline.

=== Residence: Rockingham County, Virginia ===
