== Research Notes ==

=== Parents ===
"Kline John (of Conr." first appeared in the 1819 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list.

Of Conrad Cline's known children, John B. and Mary Ann do not appear in the Friedens Church baptismal records.  The earliest baptismal record is for Elisabeth<ref>German Church Records of Rockingham County, Vol 1, Translated and compiled by Brigitte Burkett, Picton Press, Rockport, Maine, page 9</ref> b. 19 Feb 1792, which identifies her parents "Conrad Klein & wife Maria".

It is commonly understood that "Maria" is Maria Ruebush (or Raudenbusch), and that she was born about 1776.  It is possible Maria Ruebush is not the mother of John B. and Mary Ann, or that Maria Ruebush is older than commonly understood.

=== Birth ===
"Kline John (of Conr." first appeared in the 1819 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list.
* Conrad Cline's tithable count increased to 2 in 1817.
* It was still 2 in 1819, but was reduced to 1 in 1820.  Conrad's son Peter Cline would have been 21 in 1819<ref>1850 United States Federal Census, Year: 1850; Census Place: District 56, Rockingham, Virginia; Roll: M432_974; Image: 345</ref><ref>Rockingham County, Virginia, Death Index, 1853-1861</ref><ref>Tombstone image, Find a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54746398/peter-cline: accessed July 4, 2024), memorial page for Peter Cline (17 Aug 1798–8 Jul 1857), Find a Grave Memorial ID 54746398, citing Friedens United Church of Christ Cemetery, Friedens, Rockingham County, Virginia, USA; Maintained by Anonymous (contributor 47074340).</ref>,
* The tithable count was not enumerated in the tax lists from 1821-1829.
* "Peter Cline of Conrad" first appeared in the 1830 Rockingham Personal Property Tax list, at age 32.

With the assumption that "Kline John (of Conr." in the 1819 property tax is the same person as John B Cline in 1830 property tax, the birth year is calculated based on the following:
# Married without father's consent<ref> According to Virginia law, individuals under the age of twenty-one needed the consent of a parent
or guardian to marry.</ref> in 1809 = 1788 or before
# Census 1810 age 16-25 = 1785-1794
# Census 1820 age 26-44 = 1776-1794
# Census 1830 age 40-49 = 1781-1790
Birth year range is 1785-1788

=== Marriage ===
John and Susannah's marriage is listed in John Brown's minister's return.  Also included in the return's long list are Peter Cline to Christina Royer, Jacob Koontz to Nancy Cline, and other daughters of Conrad and Marie Cline.

=== Residence: Rockingham County, Virginia ===
