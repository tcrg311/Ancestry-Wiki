== Research Notes ==

=== Name ===
Throughout the church records Mary Ann is variously referred to as "Maria", "Maria Ann", and "Polly". She cannot be accounted for in the 1820 census<ref>"United States Census, 1820", , FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHLZ-YC2 : Fri Jul 05 21:52:35 UTC 2024), Entry for William Nair, 1820.</ref>, but appears in church records in 1826 (see [[#Friedens_Luthern_and_Reformed_Church_Records|Friedens Luthern and Reformed Church Records, page 109]]).

=== Parents ===
Mary Ann's [https://rockinghamcountyva-web.tylerhost.net/web/document/DOCCACS-2747165?search=DOCSEARCH133S8 Marriage Bond] shows Conrad Cline is her father.  Her mother is possibly Marie Ruebush

Of Conrad Cline's known children, Mary Ann and John B. do not appear in the Friedens Church baptismal records.  The earliest baptismal record is for Elisabeth<ref>German Church Records of Rockingham County, Vol 1, Translated and compiled by Brigitte Burkett, Picton Press, Rockport, Maine, page 9</ref> b. 19 Feb 1792, which identifies her parents "Conrad Klein & wife Maria".

It is commonly understood that "Maria" is Maria Ruebush (or Raudenbusch), and that she was born about 1776.  It is possible Maria Ruebush is not John B. and Mary Ann's mother is not , or that Maria Ruebush is older than commonly understood.

=== Do Not Confuse ===
'''William has an unmarried sister named Maria''' (see [[#Friedens_Luthern_and_Reformed_Church_Records|Friedens Luthern and Reformed Church Records]] p 126 below: "Polly Nehr", William's wife, and "Maria Nehr", William's sister), and '''care is needed in some records to distinguish between them.'''
