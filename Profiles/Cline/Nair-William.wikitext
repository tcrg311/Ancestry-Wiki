== Research Notes ==

=== Name ===
William like some of his other siblings, migrated to a new spelling Nair during his lifetime.  In Friedens Church records he is entered as Wilhelm Neher or Near or Neer.

=== Residence in Rockingham, Virginia ===
The Rockingham County Personal Property Tax list first shows William in 1809<ref>Another filming, 1992, of lists 1795-1813. (No list for 1808.), Rockingham County, Virginia, South East District, Reuben Harrison's list, page 13 {{FamilySearch Image|3Q9M-CSPG-K359-F}}</ref>, with Martin Sen, Martin Jun, and Henry Nair.

He cannot be found in the 1810 census, but is present in the 1820<ref>"United States Census, 1820", , FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHLZ-YC2 : Fri Jul 05 21:52:35 UTC 2024), Entry for William Nair, 1820.</ref>:
* Rockingham, Virginia
* 2 males under 10
* 1 male 26 and under 45
* 3 females under 10
* 1 female 10 years and under 16 years
* 1 female 16 and under 26

The oldest female does not appear old enough to be Mary Ann "Polly" (Cline) Nair. 

Personal Propety Tax:  Listed through 1853.  Not found after that.  Samuel Nair begins being listed in 1853.

=== Marriage ===
He married [[Cline-7903|Mary Ann (Cline) Neher (abt.1788-)]] 29 Sep 1809<ref>Rockingham County, Virginia - Self Service SRA, Marriage License, Document Number:  1809-00055, https://rockinghamcountyva-web.tylerhost.net/web/document/DOCCACS-2747165?search=DOCSEARCH133S8</ref>, and they had 13 children.

Throughout the church records Mary Ann is variously referred to as "Maria", "Maria Ann", and "Polly".  She cannot be accounted for in the 1820 census, but appears in church records in 1826 (see [[#Friedens_Luthern_and_Reformed_Church_Records|Friedens Luthern and Reformed Church Records, page 109]]).

William has a sister named Maria, and care is needed in some records to distinguish between them.

=== Rockingham County ===
20 Apr 1840 deed<ref>Burnt Deed Index says Burnt Deed Book 13 p 84 or 64, but not found.  Index indicates nothing of the deed survived.  See Rockingham County Minute Book 20 page 169 for court entry of the deed</ref> from John Robinson to William Nair [et al? undecipherable clerk abbreviation]
