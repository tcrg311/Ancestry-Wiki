== Research Notes ==
"George Koontz" is identified twice in the 1810 census:
# George Koontz age 26-44<ref>Year: 1810; Census Place: Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia; Roll: 71; Page: 43; Image: Vam252_71-0088; FHL Roll: 0181431</ref> in Woodstock, Shenandoah, Virginia, USA. This George is too near Eve's age to be her father. 
# George Koontz age 45 or older<ref>Year: 1810; Census Place: Shenandoah, Virginia; Roll: 71; Page: 7; Image: Vam252_71-0013; FHL Roll: 0181431</ref> in Shenandoah Valley, Shenandoah, Virginia, United States.  It's possible that this George is of a reasonable age (b. before 1766) to be Eve's father.

"George Koontz" in Virginia, with age 45 or older, occurs twice in the 1820 census:
# "George Koontz" in Stephens City, Frederick, Virginia, United States<ref>"United States, Census, 1820", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHLZ-8MH : Thu Mar 27 18:41:12 UTC 2025), Entry for George Koontz, 1820.</ref>
