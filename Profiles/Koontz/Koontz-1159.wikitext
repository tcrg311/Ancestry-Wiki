His death date is uncertain.

* He was still living in 1864:  His son Jacob G died of wounds sustained at Chancellorsville, and the Confederate records dated 2 Aug 1864<ref>Compiled service records of Confederate soldiers from Virginia units, labeled with each soldier's name, rank, and unit, with links to revealing documents about each soldier. https://www.fold3.com/image/11568452</ref> show father Jacob's signature for son Jacob's back pay.

* In the Rockingham County Personal Property Tax records, Jacob is listed through 1866, but begins to be missing in 1867<ref>Library of Virginia, microfilm reels 739-740</ref>. 

Information related to Nancy's death adds some confusion:

* A "Nancy Koontz" is listed in the U.S. Federal Census Mortality Schedule for Rockingham, and her married status is "married" and not "widowed"<ref>National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington, D.C.; Non-population Census Schedules for Virginia, 1850-1880; Archive Collection: T1132; Archive Roll Number: 10; Census Year: 1870; Census Place: Ashby, Rockingham, Virginia; Page: 390</ref>.  It is uncertain if the marital status in the census can be trusted.   (There is another "Nancy Koontz" that can be found in Rockingham in this timeframe, who was married to Samuel Koontz, but lived well beyond 1870.)
* Jacob cannot be found anywhere in the 1870 census.  
* The 1860 census shows "Sarah Koontz" as Jacob's inferred wife<ref>Year: 1860; Census Place: District 1, Rockingham, Virginia; Roll: M653_1379; Page: 608; Family History Library Film: 805379</ref>.  There is no record of an earlier death for Nancy, or of Jacob re-marrying.

Rockingham County Court Minute Books survived the Civil War intact.  An index of these minutes as they relate to estates was compiled for the years 1800-1865 by Wesley E. Pippenger <ref> Virginia Genealogical Society, Richmond, 2005)</ref>.  This Jacob Koontz is not in the index, but he is likely to have died after 1865.  The post-1865 Minute Books <ref>https://www.rockinghamcountyva.gov/667/Minute-Books</ref> could be scanned page-by-page to see if Jacob Koontz' estate ever went through probate.

Status of children 1867-1870:

* William is not living in Rockingham, and possibly not living.
* Sarah died in 1859.
* Julia's status is unknown.
* George Conrad is living in Indiana.
* Christina Lydia died in 1865.
* Peter Wilson is living in Rockingham.  (He dies in 1870.)
* Jacob G died in 1863.
* Mary Ann is living in Augusta County, married to John W. Keller.
* Elizabeth's status is unknown, but possibly dead.
* Eliza Virginia is living in Rockingham, married to Robert Evan Cox.

== Research Notes ==

In the 1850 census, Jacob's occupation is "Laborer", with no real estate of any value.  In the 1860 census, Jacob's occupation is "Farmer", with real estate valued at $1,200 and personal estate valued at $452.  Correlating information does not support this:

* Rockingham Land Tax for 1860<ref>Land tax lists, 1857-1861, Land tax lists of Rockingham County [Virginia] 1782-1863, Virginia. Commissioner of the Revenue (Rockingham County), Salt Lake City, Utah : Filmed by the Genealogical Society of Utah, 1955</ref> does not list him.
* Rockingham Personal Property Tax for 1860<ref>Personal property tax lists 1859-1860 image 478, Personal property tax lists of Rockingham County, 1782-1863, Virginia. Commissioner of the Revenue (Rockingham County), Salt Lake City, Utah : Filmed by the Genealogical Society of Utah, 1955</ref> shows a personal property aggregate value of $80.
* A search of deed indexes of Augusta or Shenandoah counties cannot find Jacob Koontz.
