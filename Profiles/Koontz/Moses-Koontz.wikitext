== Research Notes ==

=== Birth ===
The name of Moses' father has not been found in any record.  Death registry lists only "Eve Koontz" as parent.  There is a close association with Moses' stepfather, John Newland, who co-signed a Chancery Court bond<ref>Moses Koontz vs George Ruddell, bond dated 9 Oct 1821.</ref>, and made some provisions in his will<ref></ref>:
<blockquote>It is my will and desire that my wife son Moses live on the premises with his mother undisturbed until such sale as named in the first item be effected or as long as my wife lives in order to assist her in raising the children</blockquote>

=== Marriage ===
There is some confusion between Nancy (Urt) Koontz (b. Abt. 1801) of Shenandoah County and Nancy (Cline) Koontz (b. Abt. 1804) of Rockingham County.  The U.S. Federal Census Mortality Schedule for 1870<ref>National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington, D.C.; Non-population Census Schedules for Virginia, 1850-1880; Archive Collection: T1132; Archive Roll Number: 10; Census Year: 1870; Census Place: Ashby, Rockingham, Virginia; Page: 390</ref> shows a "Nancy Koontz" who died in Apr 1870 at age 65.  This entry has been applied to Nancy Urt in most family trees in Ancestry, and also asserted by Lowell Koontz from his research.

Nancy Koontz was identified as the wife of Moses Koontz 10 MAR 1854 in his death registry entry.
