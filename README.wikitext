=== Ancestry Wiki ===
This repository is for sharing Ancestry information with an emphasis on contemporary/primary source material, in an effort to provide as much factual information as is available and accessible for greater accuracy in family trees.

Process:
# Gather documents contemporary to the person being researched:  Marriage records, deeds, wills, tax records, etc.
# Arrange a timeline of facts based on the documents.
# Provide a biography with "just enough" narrative language to connect the documented facts.
# Clearly identify any information that is an estimate or guess or "possibility", and explain the reasoning or calculation.
# Any conclusions should follow the rule of "fewest assumptions".
