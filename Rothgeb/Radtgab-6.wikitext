=== Migration from Switzerland to Philadelphia ===

In ''A history of the Goshenhoppen Reformed charge''<ref>A history of the Goshenhoppen Reformed charge, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania (1727-1819), William John Hinke, Lancaster [Press of the New era printing company], 1920, https://archive.org/details/historyofgoshen00hink, pp. 97ff</ref>  John Henke describes the departure from Zurich, based on an 7 Oct 1734 article in ''Nachrichten von Zurich'', a local newspaper.  The article tells of three boats that left Zurich for "the so called Carolina island".

The first departure was led by Maurice Goetschy, with his wife and children, and a "considerable number of country people, old and young".

:Shortly afterwards another boat followed him with like, we must say, silly people, making a total of 174 persons for that day.  Many thousands saw them depart with great pity for them, especially because they were undertaking so thoughtlessly, with wife and child, and but poorly provided for, the dangerous journey of 300 hours in cold, rain and wind, now, when the days are getting shorter.  Nevertheless, kindhearted and distinguished persons supplied them 
with bread, shawls, caps, etc.  The following day the third boat started off.  These were liberally provided, from the office of charities, with a large amount of bread, flour, stockings and other supplies.  Especially the neighborhood of the exchange showed itself deeply sympathetic; nor will they likely to forget what was given to them at Salthouse for bodily refreshment.  In like manner many merchants assisted them.  Upon the last boat were 82 persons, who would have been worthy of more consideration if they had been compelled to leave for the honor of the truth of God.  They must bear the consequences of their act, be they good or ill.


Henke continues with an account of the voyage, based on a pamphlet<ref>The title page of this pamphlet reads: ''Der Hinckende Bott von Carolina oder Ludwig Webers von Walliselen Beschreibung seiner Reise von Zurich gen Rotterdam, mit derjenigen Gesellschaft welch neulich aus dem Schweizerland nach Carolinam zu ziehen gedachte'', Zurich, MDCCXXXV, pp. 32. Only known copy in the city library at Zurich.</ref> written and published at Zurich in 1735 "as a warning to later venturesome spirits."

The pamphlet describes the emigrants' reliance on charity whenever more money was needed.  For example, securing a passport at Basle cost 44 guilders, "which some gentlement at Basle paid for them", and "They were fortunate enough to secure alms at several places along the route and, although they had many quarrels and
difficulties, they finally reached Rotterdam eight days after the main party."

:When they reached Neuwied four couples were married by a Reformed minister:
:# Hans Conrad Wirtz and Anna Goetschy.
:# Conrad Naff, of Walliselen and Anna N.---
:# Jacob Rathgeb and Barbara Haller, both of Walliselen.
:# Conrad Geweiller, a gardener.

Ultimately, Maurice Goetschy "received...assurance of his appointment as minister to Pennsylvania, he returned to Rotterdam and acquainted his party of emigrants with his changed plans.  Most of them readily accepted his proposal to change their destination from Carolina to Pennsylvania."

In ''Brumbach family genealogy''<ref>Genealogy of the Brumbach families, Gaius Marcus Brumbach, Frederick H Hitchcock Genealogical Publisher, New York, 1913, p 273</ref>, Gaius Marcus Brumbach identifies Jacob as a "Redemptioner", a colonial emigrant from Europe to America who paid for the voyage by serving for a specified period as a bondservant.

IN ''A History of Shenandoah County Virginia''<ref>A History of Shenandoah County Virginia, John W. Wayland, Shenandoah Publishing House, Strasburg, Virginia, 1927, page 636</ref> John Wayland states:

:There is a Roadcap genealogy in the large "Genealogy of the Brumbach Families".  There are some errors in this Roadcap or Rothgeb record, which are reprinted in Stricklers "Forerunners".  The stirps, John Jacob Rothgeb, died about 1752, owner of 400 acres in the Page area, was not a redemptioner.

Wayland did not provide a source or basis for this conclusion.

It is difficult to assess the Redemptioner status from this contemporary narrative because it is not known how the "143 persons" paid for their passage, and it is not known how "some others who evidently joined them" (and evidently including Jacob and Barbara) managed paying for their passage.

As a result, it is undetermined whether Jacob was truly a Redemptioner or not.  

=== Marriage ===
<u>(1) Barbara Haller m. 1734 and m. 1740</u>

As noted in the migration, Jacob married Barbara Haller at Neuwied in 1734, on their way from Zurich to Philadelphia.  Considering the piety of the travelers, it is possible that this was needed to allow single men and women to travel together.  The marriage appears not to have been consummated until after their arrival and period of indenture.  Generally, the indenture contract would have required them to live separately, and afterward they may have needed to marry again in Virginia for social and/or legal reasons.

In ''Brumbach family genealogy''<ref>Genealogy of the Brumbach families, Gaius Marcus Brumbach, Frederick H Hitchcock Genealogical Publisher, New York, 1913, p 273</ref>, Gaius Marcus Brumbach describes Hans Jacob's arrival in America and family as follows:

:According to tradition among some of his Virginia descendants, he and a young woman, his fellow passenger across the Atlantic, served ''Joseph Strickler'' for seven years.

Brumbach cites several laws about indenture, and notes difference in the duration of the term among them, so the term could have been shorter.  

While unable to identify the "young woman", he continues:

:After their service to Strickler ended they married and had one son, ''George''.  After the death of this wife Jacob Roadcap married a widow ''Good'' (first name unknown), and had by her one child, ''Peter''.<ref>Brumbach does not provide any references for this information.</ref>

Adopting the view that Jacob and Barbara married in 1734 but did not have children until 1741 requires accounting for the gap.  There may have been other reasons for a period of indenture, such as lack of money or the promise of land.  Because of the family story that they were indentured, and because the duration of the gap falls within a typical timeframe of indenture, we assume that the family story is true.

<u>(2) Anna Naef m. ~1750?</u>

In his 1752 will, Jacob names is "dear wife" Anna.  Anna is said to be the widow of Caspar Guth/Good.  After Jacob's death (and before his probate) Anna married George Hollonbeck, named as guardian in the 1762 bond.

=== Children ===

With Barbara Haller:
* John George b. Abt 1741
* Elizabeth
* Anna/Hanah
* Barbara
* Catherine

With Anna Naef:
* Peter b. Abt 1751

Taking the Brumbach information and identifying the names of Hans Jacob's wives, and parsing the specific words used, the "one son" phrasing would place John George and all of Hans Jacob's daughters with Barbara Haller, and Peter ("one child") would have been the only child with Anna (Naef) Good.

Noting the orphan list in the guardian bond, the oldest child, John George, was likely born about 1741 (i.e. 21 years old in 1762) and daughters Elizabeth, Anna/Hanah, Barbara, & Catherine after that.  Peter is the youngest and likely born about 1751.
