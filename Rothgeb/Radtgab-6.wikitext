It's unclear if the will and  probate dates are Julian or Gregorian.  If Julian then 11 days would need to be subtracted.]

=== Migration from Switzerland to Philadelphia ===

Henke<ref>A history of the Goshenhoppen Reformed charge, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania (1727-1819), William John Hinke, Lancaster [Press of the New era printing company], 1920, p 101, https://archive.org/details/historyofgoshen00hink/page/100/mode/2up</ref> lists "Jacob Rathgeb and Barbara Haller" among four couples who were married by a Reformed minister in Neuwied in October 1734.  This history documents the arrival of this group of Swiss emigrants in Philadelphia 29 May 1735 using contemporary accounts of the passage<ref>Hinke, pp 96-107</ref>.

=== Marriage ===
Brumbach family genealogy<ref>Genealogy of the Brumbach families, Gaius Marcus Brumbach, Frederick H Hitchcock Genealogical Publisher, New York, 1913, p 273</ref> describes Hans Jacob's arrival in America and family as follows:

:According to tradition among some of his Virginia descendants, he and a young woman, his fellow passenger across the Atlantic, served ''Joseph Strickler'' for seven years.

The genealogy cites several laws about indenture, and notes difference in the duration of the term among them, so the term could have been shorter.  While unable to identify the "young woman", the it continues:

:After their service to Strickler ended they married and had one son, ''George''.  After the death of this wife Jacob Roadcap married a widow ''Good'' (first name unknown), and had by her one child, ''Peter''.<ref>Brumbach does not provide any references for this information.</ref>

Taking the Brumbach information and identifying the names of Hans Jacob's wives, and parsing the specific words used, the "one son" phrasing would place John George and all of Hans Jacob's daughters with Barbara Haller, and Peter ("one child") would have been the only child with Anna (Naef) Good.

Given the era, it would be surprising for a couple married in 1734 to avoid childbirth until (for example) 1740.  However, in this case childbirth would have imposed significant difficulties on their migration and their period of indenture. Considering that childbirth might have been delayed during during migration and a five or six year indenture, and noting the orphan list in the guardian bond, the oldest child may have been born about 1741 and the other children born after that.  

There are no documents that show Jacob and Barbara in a period of indenture, or to substantiate whether Jacob was truly a Redemptioner (a colonial emigrant from Europe to America who paid for the voyage by serving for a specified period as a bondservant) or not.  Wayland<ref>A History of Shenandoah County Virginia, John W. Wayland, Shenandoah Publishing House, Strasburg, Virginia, 1927, page 636</ref> states:

:There is a Roadcap genealogy in the large "Genealogy of the Brumbach Families".  There are some errors in this Roadcap or Rothgeb record, which are reprinted in Stricklers "Forerunners".  The stirps, John Jacob Rothgeb, died about 1752, owner of 400 acres in the Page area, was not a redemptioner.

Wayland did not provide a source or basis for this conclusion.

Henke<ref>Henke p 106</ref> cites a pamphlet describing the migration written by Ludwig Weber, who reports "88 as taking ship to England", and

:[t]he rest, 143 persons, signed their names for passage to Philadelphia.  They agreed with the owner of a ship [Schiffpatron] to pay six doubloons for an adult and three for a child. If any of them should die, the survivors pledged themselves to pay their passage money.

Henke transcribed the list of passengers provided by Weber, but the list does not include Jacob and Barbara.  Henke<ref>Henke p 107</ref> continues...

:This company with some others who evidently joined them after Ludwig Weber had started on his return journey to Switzerland, and whose names he could not therefore record, reached Philadelphia on May 29, 1735, in the ship Mercury, William Wilson, master. It carried in all 186 passengers, 61 men, 51 women, 37 boys and 34 girls.

It is difficult to assess the Redemptioner status from this contemporary narrative because it is not known how the "143 persons" paid for their passage, and it is not known how "some others who evidently joined them" (and evidently including Jacob and Barbara) managed paying for their passage.

As a result, it is undetermined whether Jacob was truly a Redemptioner (a colonial emigrant from Europe to America who paid for the voyage by serving for a specified period as a bondservant) or not.  

Adopting the view that Jacob and Barbara married in 1734 but did not have children until 1741 requires accounting for the gap.  There may have been other reasons for a period of indenture, such as lack of money or the promise of land.  Because of the family story that they were indentured, and because the duration of the gap falls within a typical timeframe of indenture, we assume that the family story is true.

In this analysis, because Peter and John George did not sell their inherited land until 1772, it is possible to consider that this timing coincided with Peter reaching majority, and the basis for thinking his birth year could be as late as 1751.
