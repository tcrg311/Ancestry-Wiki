In the marriage document, his parents are shown as Isaac Mathias and Mahala Daugherty.  Amanda's parents are John Hawse and Christena Mauck.
* Isaac Mathews (or Mathias) married Mahala Dougherty 6 Oct 1842<ref>Ancestry.com. Virginia, U.S., Select Marriages, 1785-1940 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc, 2014.</ref><ref>Rockingham County, Virginia - Self Service SRA, Marriage Document 1842-00080, https://rockinghamcountyva-web.tylerhost.net/web/document/DOCCACS-2736528?search=DOCSEARCH133S8</ref>.  Mahala is daughter of Valentine Dougherty.
* Mahala Mathews subsequently married David Lamb 27 Aug 1857<ref>https://rockinghamcountyva-web.tylerhost.net/web/document/DOCCACS-2730540?search=DOCSEARCH133S8</ref>.  The marriage certificate indicates that Mahala is a widow, and daughter of Valentine Dougherty and Mary his wife.
* In the 1850 census, Isaac and Ann Rudy appear next after Mahala, Erasmus and Peter.  Isaac Rudy married Ann Roadcap 3 Oct 1840<ref>Rockingham County, Virginia - Self Service SRA, marriage document 1820-00071, https://rockinghamcountyva-web.tylerhost.net/web/document/DOCCACS-2745207?search=DOCSEARCH133S8</ref>, and the bond shows that she is the daughter of Peter Roadcap Sr.  [William Herron's "Sr" can look like "Jr", but inspection of his list of tithables in the 1820 personal property tax list corroborates that Ann's father is "Sr" and not "Jr".]  The marriage bond is signed by "Peter Roadcap" ("his mark"), without specifying Sr or Jr.
