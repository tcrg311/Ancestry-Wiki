=== Birth ===
Jacob's will 19 Dec 1752<ref>Augusta County, Will books, v. 1 1745-1753, film 30314, Will Book 1, page 497</ref> makes account for a time when John George would be "at age", and no similar account is made for the other children, particularly Peter, who was to inherit half the land.  Possibly because of this, it is often assumed only John George had not attained majority by the time Jacob died.

However, on 19 May 1762:  "Ord. Church Wardens bind Peter Road Cap, Eliz, Hanah, Barbara, & Cath Roadcap orphans of Jacob Rodcap to Geo. Hollowback."<ref>Augusta County Minute Book, 1762, page 31, Court session 19 May 1762, Library of Virginia, Augusta County microfilm, Reel 62D</ref>.  Chalkley adds "Moses Maiden to be bound."<ref>Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish settlement in Virginia, Lyman Chalkley, [Virginia] : M.S. Lockwood, 1912, Vol 1 Page 97, https://www.familysearch.org/library/books/viewer/202922/?offset=0#page=97&viewer=picture&o=info&n=0&q=</ref>.

John George is missing from the list of orphans being bonded, making it possible to assume that he had attained majority, while his siblings had not, and that John George is Jacob's oldest son and oldest child.  On the basis of the information in the guardian bond (i.e. at least 21 in 1762), John George's birth year is estimated at 1741.
